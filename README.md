# TruthLabyrinth: Find the Mole 

## Created by: Guild 21

### 🎯 Game Overview
TruthLabyrinth is a logic-based C++ game where the player interviews secret agents to uncover which one is lying — the **mole**. The player gets 3 interviews and 1 final guess to find the truth.

---

### 🧩 How It Works
- Agent data (names and statements) is loaded from `data/questions.txt`.
- One agent is randomly assigned as the mole.
- The player picks 3 agents to interview.
- After reading the statements, the player guesses who the mole is.
- The game tells you if you're right or wrong.
- Score is tracked across multiple rounds.

### 🔁 Bonus Features

- **Score tracking** — wins and losses are counted during the session.
- **Clean terminal output** with emoji-enhanced UI for a fun experience!

### ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Open the Xcode project or compile `main.cpp` using a C++ compiler.
2. Ensure `questions.txt` is inside a folder named `data` in the same directory.
3. Build and run the game!
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal to play and guess the mole.
