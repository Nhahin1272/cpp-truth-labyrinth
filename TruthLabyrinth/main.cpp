/*
  TruthLabyrinth: Find the Mole
  Author: Nhahin Uddin
  Description: A logic game where the player interviews agents to find which one is lying.
  The game reads agent data from a file and uses C++ fundamentals like structs, loops,
  conditionals, file I/O, and vectors. Includes replay support and win/loss tracking.
  To run: Make sure 'questions.txt' is in the 'data/' folder next to the executable.
